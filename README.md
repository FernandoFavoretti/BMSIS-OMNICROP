# BMSIS-OMNICROP
OMNICROP uses a database composed of labeled data such as light quality and quantity, general climate characteristics and soil quality from successful farming sites. This data is then used to sort and select the most successful crops for a particular set of circumstances. This process can provide either earthbound farmers or off-world colonists with the a-priori information needed to start successful, productive food production while preventing costly and time-consuming mistakes that derive from on-site experimentation or be directly linked to self-managing cultivation chambers. This project is an open source model where any user can input data and obtain results. Frequent reuse will assist the models to “learn” and continually re-calibrate itself providing increasingly accurate results over time. If selected, the candidate will assist with organizing the labeled data and on programming the model as well as be given full liberty to come up with new ideas on how to integrate the model’s premise on building cheap self-managing cultivation chambers using IoT.
